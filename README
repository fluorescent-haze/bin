Binary Package Repository
________________________________________________________________________________


This repository contains prebuilt binaries for the more time-consuming packages
to build from source in the kiss-community repositories.

These binaries are distributed as kiss-compliant packages. This means that you
can simply download the release tarball you want and do kiss i path/to/package
and kiss will install it for you!

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and use it in the usual way. The prebuilt
package is simply downloaded and copies to "$1/usr" during the 'build'.


Caveats
________________________________________________________________________________

* This repository may lag behind the latest version available in the main
  repositories, especially for frequently updated packages like cmake or nodejs.

* These packages are all built in a regular KISS chroot release tarball with
  generic C{XX}FLAGS, built identically to their source-based counterparts.

* These packages are submitted and maintained by members of the community, not
  Dylan Araps. Trust these packages accordingly.
